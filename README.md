# Elevate-Labs-Task-3-Linear-Regression
Steps Performed
Data Loading
A small dataset of house listings was manually loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

Feature Target Split

X: All features except price

y: Target variable price

Z-score Normalization
Standardization of all features was done using StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing to bring them to a common scale (mean = 0, std = 1).

Train-Test Split
Data was split into training and test sets using train_test_split() with a test size of 25%.

Model Training
A Linear Regression model was trained using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.

Model Evaluation

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MSE (Mean Squared Error)

RÂ² Score were computed using scikit-learn metrics.

Visualization
A scatter plot was created to compare actual vs predicted house prices based on the area feature.
